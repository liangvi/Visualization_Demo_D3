<h1>Text Analysis of the Yelp Dataset</h1>
Matt D’Intino & Victor Liang
DS 5500 April 2019

Motivation:
A restaurateur looking to open a new restaurant or expand an existing restaurant to a new location is faced with the following problem: “what type of restaurant would have the highest success in this location, or what location would make this type of restaurant the most successful?” Using text reviews curated by the website Yelp, this study investigates the effects of location and restaurant type on a reviewer’s rating of a restaurant. The hypothesis being tested is that users in one American city will rate restaurants of a certain type differently than users in another American city, and these ratings are a reasonable indication of the restaurant’s success.
